# School Entrance for Three.js Journey

A fun interactive 3D school entrance made with Three.js, WebGL, Javascript and Blender. The colours of the water are editable, allowing you to enter your own custom hex codes if desired, along with adjusting the size of the fireflies and the colour of the background too. Have fun!
